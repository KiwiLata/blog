Today I kept working my way through TOP curriculum, I managed to finish all javascript exercises from Foundations module and I started working on the last project, calculator. I did not finish it as I spontaneously joined Bi-weekly contest on LeetCode - I managed to finish the first two problems (contest 136), and started the third one, which I'm quite happy about!
