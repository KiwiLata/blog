      <description>Today I kept working my way through TOP curriculum, I managed to finish all javascript exercises from Foundations module and I started working on the last project, calculator. I did not finish it as I spontaneously joined Bi-weekly contest on LeetCode - I managed to finish the first two problems (contest 136), and started the third one, which I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy about!</description>

      <description>Today I worked on the last lesson of The Odin Project&amp;rsquo;s Foundations module. I learned how to use map(), filter() and reduce() on arrays. Coidentically today&amp;rsquo;s LeetCode daily challenge was solvable by these methods, which is a nice chance to practice them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working through The Odin Project and yesterday I completed Etch-a-Sketch project fromt the curriculum. Coding it brought me a lot more of joy than I expected. My biggest challenge with this project was figuring out how to handle mouse events.&#xA;Etch-a-Sketch on my laptop. An alien I drew on my phone. My friends have also sent me a couple of cool drawings made with it:&#xA;Abstract art. A kitty. Rigth now mobile devices require to click to colour a tile, instead of hovering over it which makes drawing much easier.</description>
