I'm working through The Odin Project and yesterday I completed Etch-a-Sketch project fromt the curriculum. Coding it brought me a lot more of joy than I expected. My biggest challenge with this project was figuring out how to handle mouse events.

My friends have also sent me a couple of cool drawings made with it:

![A cat head.](../images/etch-a-sketch-cat.jpg "A kitty.")

Rigth now mobile devices require to click to colour a tile, instead of hovering over it which makes drawing much easier. 

Some developemnt ideas I gathered while talking with friends:
* require pressing a mouse button to draw on PC
* colour picker (a palette + random colour option)
* export image
* animations (a wave reversing all colours, changing colour tiles)
* scale the canvas size to the screen size
* pre-defined canvas size buttons
